Clima ☁

Weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Adin Yanuar](https://dribbble.com/shots/15292603-Weather-Conceptual-App-Design). You'll be able to find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of!

During the development of this app, I've learned various dart functionalities such as:

    •	Use Dart to perform asynchronous tasks.
    •	Understand async and await.
    •	Learn about Futures and how to work with them.
    •	How to network with the Dart HTTP package.
    •	What APIs are and how to use them to get data from the internet.
    •	What JSONs are and how to parse them using the Dart convert package.
    •	How to pass data forwards and backward between screens using the Navigator.
    •	How to handle exceptions in Dart using try/catch/throw.
    •	Learn about the lifecycle of Stateful Widgets and how to override them.
    •	How to use the Geolocator package to get live location data for both iOS and Android.
    •	How to use the TextField Widget to take user input.
